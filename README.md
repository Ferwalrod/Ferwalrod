- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ferwalrod and I'm a videogame programmer. During the Bachelor's degree, I realized the game industry was my passion and that's why I started to learn in 
a self-taught way. At the end of my Bachelor's degree, I developed a videogame using Unreal engine 4. Nowadays I'm doing a Master's degree in game development to learn
more and become a professional in the industry. 
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Automation or build and gameplay. These are branches in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal engine 4, Unity, Jenkins, C++, C#, PhysX
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything
- 📫 How to reach me -> infofews@gmail.com
